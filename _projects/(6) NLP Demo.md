characteristic: [Personal project]
description: Use streamlit to develop a demo that can showcase solving variety of NLP problems using pre-trained Transformer models
---
### Objective
 To experiment with solving different NLP tasks including Extractive Question Answering, Summarization, 
 Named Entity Recognition using pre-trained transformer models of different types including only 
 Encoder model like Roberta and both Encoder and Decoder autoregressive models like Roberta2Roberta for 
 summarization.
