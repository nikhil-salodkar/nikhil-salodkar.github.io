description: Train a Convolutional Neural Network to classify and predict similar fashion items
---
### Objective
Create and train a classification model using Convolutional Nerual Network architectures like ResNet to 
classify images into different product categories and subcategories and use the trained Neural Network to 
generate images embeddings which could help in creating a simple visual similarity recommendation system.
