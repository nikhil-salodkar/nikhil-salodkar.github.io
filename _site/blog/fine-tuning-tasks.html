<p>One of the major reasons of the popularity of transformer models were their ability to be
fine-tuned effectively on myriad downstream NLP tasks achieving great performance. The unsupervised
pre-training strategies helped the transformer model to gain intuition and understanding around how
language and text works which in turn facilitates easier fine-tuning using relatively less amount of
supervised data for downstream NLP tasks.</p>

<p>In this post we will look at variety of downstream NLP tasks which we can exploit using transformer
based models and briefly touch upon how they are trained.</p>

<h1 id="popular-nlp-tasks">Popular NLP tasks</h1>
<p>There are many types of NLP tasks which can be useful in solving real world problems. We can broadly
categorize the tasks into:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Text classification</li>
  <li>Token classification</li>
  <li>Text generation</li>
  <li>Information Extraction</li>
  <li>Similarity prediction</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look into each category and their subcategories in more detail.</p>

<h2 id="text-classification">Text classification</h2>
<p>Text classification is the most basic form of task which is useful in many real world applications.
Text classification can be defined as classifying text (sentence/paragraph/document) into set of
<strong>pre-defined classes</strong>. The classification could be multi-class classification where multiple classes
are present but each text can belong to only one of the classes, and it could be multi-label classification
where a text could belong to multiple classes. The important point in classification is that the classes
are pre-defined.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples">Real world Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong> : It refers to predicting the sentiment of a text, whether the sentiment is positive
  or negative. Thus, this is a binary classification problem with only two classes positive and negative.
  Useful in scenarios to assess sentiment of customers like in movie or product reviews, service review,
  Social media and news comments etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Topic detection</strong> : Could be a multi-class or multi-label problem, for example, to help in tagging
  topics in social media posts, forums, research papers like in Quora, Stackoverflow, reddit, arxiv etc.
  Or in detecting Intent of what is requested for a chatbot.</li>
  <li><strong>Sequential sentence classification</strong> : Similar to topic detection, but
  instead of predicting one topic independently for single input text, multiple topics are predicted
  for a sequence of text. For example, with research paper abstract as input predicting which sentences
  are part of introduction, which sentences shows procedure and which sentences give results. Another
  example is given a document automatically classify important sentences inside that document.
    <h3 id="how-it-works-and-fine-tuned">How it works and fine-tuned</h3>
    <p>Fine-tuning text classification generally involves feeding complete input text into the transformer model and
pooling/aggregating the transformer output in some way before forwarding the output to feed forward layers which can
perform classification. The input text may also contain special tokens if necessary to provide special meaning to
some parts of text, like assigning special token after every sentence in a paragraph.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="popular-datasets">Popular Datasets</h3>
<h2 id="token-classification">Token classification</h2>
<p>In token classification, as the name suggests, instead of classifying multiple set of words/tokens as in text classification,
the task is to classify each token separately. Otherwise, the concept of classification remains the same. There are
many popular subtypes this task can encompass.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples-1">Real world Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Named Entity Recognition</strong> : In this task Entities can be comprised multiple tokens and the job of the classification
  task is to identify whether the correct tokens are entities and what type of entities they are. For example,
  in a sentence entities could refer to Names of people, organisations, Place, name of medicine, name of disease etc.
  It is the job of the algorithm, given an input sentence predict the entities of interest present in that sentence
  correctly. This could be useful in applications like identifying what places were mentioned in text, data mining
  applications to analyze important entities were mentioned and in which context they were used, for example finding
  symptoms in Electronic medical record.</li>
  <li><strong>POS tagging</strong> : This task assigns Part of speech tag to each of the word. This might help in further assessment of written
  text to for example, checking grammatical mistakes or spelling mistakes.</li>
  <li><strong>Phrase detection</strong> : Refers to detecting phrases(set of tokens) of interest into specific pre-defined classes
  or just classifying whether the phrases are important or not considering the context. For example, detecting
  important phrases in a text might help in applications like assisted fast reading, automatic highlighting,
  summarizing a document with important words or for improving and speeding further document classification task.</li>
</ul>

<p>The output of token classification algorithms often act as important inputs to more sophisticated algorithms like
in a chatbot.</p>

<h3 id="how-it-works-and-fine-tuned-1">How it works and fine-tuned</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning works similar to text classification, where input is the text containing the tokens which need to be
classified, but instead of pooling/aggregating whole text embeddings, classification head is applied to each token
separately. An example is provided below.</p>

<p>To do : diagram</p>

<h3 id="popular-datasets-1">Popular Datasets</h3>
<h2 id="text-generation">Text generation</h2>
<p>The text generation task can be any task which requires <strong>generating</strong> new text given text the model has seen so far.
Here, generating means, producing new text which may/may not be present in the input text. The newly generated
text should be analogous in some way to the input text. This is in contrast to classification approaches mentioned
above which did not require generative capabilities. There exist many such text generation tasks as explained below.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-examples-2">Real world Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Next word/s prediction</strong> : As the name suggests, this type of task’s goal is to predict automatically relevant next
  words given previous words. For example, in applications like Autocomplete feature for fast typing, assisted searching, writing and
  grammar assistance, automated reply in chatbots etc.</li>
  <li><strong>Text rephrasing</strong> : Since, the model is capable of generating new words or sentences, it can also be used for
  applications like automated sentence rephrasing assistance, grammatical error correction, Question creation
  from text.</li>
  <li><strong>Text summarization</strong> : Summarization of large documents to small summaries in abstractive way will need both identifying
  and rephrasing important information in appropriate grammatical manner. This can only be done using model text
  generation capabilities.
    <h3 id="how-it-works-and-fine-tuned-2">How it works and fine-tuned</h3>
    <p>Unlike, the classification approaches which could be solved using only the encoder portion of transformer architecture,
the generative task generally requires either a decoder alone or both encoder and decoder. Some autoregressive
mechanism is required for generative task as generating new words/tokens always need information about what was
predicted by the model itself in previous time steps. A general outline of how generative tasks would work and
fine-tuned can be seen in the diagram below.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="popular-datasets-2">Popular Datasets</h3>
<h2 id="information-extraction">Information Extraction</h2>
<p>Any task which would help in extracting/pinpointing relevant information from a document given a query can be
regarded as an information extraction problem. Information extraction can be solved using either transforming the
problem to classification task or text generation task. The difference from types of tasks is that here, instead of
just providing input text to act upon, the model is provided both input text for information extraction and a query
to find that information in the input text. Popular information extraction tasks include:</p>

<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Extractive Question Answering</strong> : Given a text/para and a question as input, the model predicts start and end
  positions of the correct answer if present. This could be helpful in applications like searching facts and Answering
  FAQ’S.</li>
  <li><strong>Abstractive Question Answering</strong> : Similar to Extractive Question answering but instead of finding locations of answers
  the answer needs to be generative using generative modelling because either exact extractive answer might not be
  present or rephrased answer is more suitable.</li>
  <li><strong>Information retrieval</strong> : This is similar to Extractive Question Answering the text where information is to be
  searched is very large and cannot all fit in one model. Thus, information retrieval is the task of finding locations
  or paragraphs where the answer to the input query is liable to find. This information can be input into extractive
  question answering pipeline.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-it-works-and-fine-tuned-3">How it works and fine-tuned</h3>
<p>Its working is almost same as classification model. For example, extractive question answering can be solved by
token classification where each token is classified whether it is start or end token of correct answer. The tokens
having the highest probabilities will be chosen as answers. Similarly, for abstractive question answering, first the
input text and question would be input into the encoder and the decoder would be used autoregressively to predict
the generated answer. The diagram below summarizes the working.</p>

<h2 id="embeddings-generation-and-similarity-prediction">Embeddings generation and Similarity prediction</h2>
<p>In all the above tasks discussed, the prediction by a model happens immediately after it receives the necessary
input. This type of prediction is very well suited for many applications but can be slow when we want to perform
a very large number of predictions in very short time. Suppose, we want to run a K nearest neighbour algorithm
on corpus having 100,000 documents. By following above approaches, given an input document, we first will have to generate
embedding of the input document and then generate embeddings for each of the 100,000 documents and compare them each.
This will cause a lot of time for a simple query. So, it makes sense to pre-compute appropriate embeddings, and then
apply K nearest neighbour on them. Such type of approach requires algorithms to fine-tune models in such a way that
they are capable of generating effective embeddings which could then be stored and used later.</p>

<h4 id="example-tasks">Example tasks</h4>
<ul>
  <li>K nearest neighbour : Given a sentence/text/query, generate its embedding and find the K nearest neighbours in a
  database of large number of target texts. Could be useful in applications like similar documents recommendation,
  duplicate document search, plagiarism detection, Contextual search etc</li>
  <li>Clustering : When model is capable of generating appropriate embeddings of text where actual similar text is close
  to each other following some metric and dissimilar text are far away from each other, we can use clustering
  algorithms like K means to cluster documents informatively which can cluster based on similar topics or relevant
  criterion</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-it-works-and-fine-tuned-4">How it works and fine-tuned</h3>
<p>Fine-tuning of appropriate embeddings generation can be done using creating suitable similarity/scoring function, and training
the model by preparing right positive and negative samples. The idea will be to train the model parameters in such a
way that similar items will have higher similarity score and dissimilar items will have very low or negative similarity
scores. Loss function such as Triplet loss function, contrastive loss function and even simple cross entropy loss
function could be utilized to fine-tune such model.
The overview of this fine-tuning can be summarized using below diagram.</p>

<h1 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h1>
<p>As we saw, transformer models can be used to fine-tune many downstream NLP tasks, the reason for which
they have become so popular. The use of such tasks in collaboration with each other can in turn
help in building very complex applications in multiple domains including Entertainment and Social media, Medical and 
Pharma, Sales and Accounting, Banking or any other domain which needs processing and understanding large amount of
textual data.</p>
